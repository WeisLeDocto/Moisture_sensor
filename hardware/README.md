This folder contains all the necessary information for replicating the moisture
sensor project. The bill of materials lists all the items to order from Mouser.
The two .stl files contain the data needed for 3D-printing the upper and lower 
halves of the casing. And the .zip archive contains all the data needed for

contains a .kicad_pcb file that can alone be sent to a PCB manufacturer for
ordering the PCB.
