# Tools

This folder contains tools that are not strictly needed to have the project
running, but were helpful at some point. The font.png file contains all the 8x8
ASCII characters used for displaying messages on the screen. The bitmap.py file
takes the font.png file as an input, and converts all the characters to a 
binary format. The links.txt file contains useful URLs related to the project.
The console.sh file is a shell script allowing to easily open a MicroPython
console on the microcontroller. Finally, the upload.sh file is a shell script 
allowing to easily upload files to the microcontroller.
